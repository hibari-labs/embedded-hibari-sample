#
# Format:
# Each item description to watch is specified on 1 line. An item description
# is comprised of 9 different comma separated fields. No spaces are allowed
# around the commas. The following describes each field.
#
# 1: WHAT TO WATCH - The field is has three colon separated fields.
#    The first field can be 'mnesia', 'apply' or 'gen_server'. Remaining fields:
#      mnesia -> 2nd field is 'items' or 'bytes', 3rd is table name
#      apply -> 2nd if module and 3rd is function with 0 args
#      gen_server -> 2nd is 'items' and 3rd is the gen_server process name
# 2: INTERVAL - to check this item for congestion. This is specified in millis.
# 3: ENABLED - true if item is enabled, false to disable monitoring.
# 4: LOW WATER MARK - If congested the item will return to the uncongested state
#    once the size falls below this mark.
# 5: WARN WATER MARK - A warning will be written to the log file once the size of
#    the item reaches this size. No further warning will be issued unless the size
#    falls below the low water mark or rises above the high water mark.
# 6: HIGH WATER MARK - Once the high water mark is reached, the item is considered
#    to be congested. A restriction message will be sent to the RESTRICT_WHO field.
# 7: RESTRICT WHO - The process which needs to receive the restriction messages or
#    undefined for logging only if there is nobody to restrict.
# 8: RESTRICT MSEC - Number of millis the RESTRICT WHO process should impose a
#    restriction for before assuming it can continue again.
# 9: RESTRICT WHAT - A colon separated list of items to restrict.
